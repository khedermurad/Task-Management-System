# Task-Management-System
This is a REST-based task management application designed to help users efficiently manage and track tasks within projects. The backend is built using Spring Boot and utilizes a PostgreSQL database to handle data storage and operations. The frontend is implemented with Angular, offering an interactive drag-and-drop interface for task organization across three statuses: Pending, In Progress, and Done. Users can create and manage projects, add, edit, and delete tasks.
